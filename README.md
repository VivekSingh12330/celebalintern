## üóÇÔ∏è Week 1 Tasks: Linux Essentials, Git Basics & Version Control

---

### üîπ Task 1: File Creation & Permission Management

**Objective:**  

Create a file, assign read, write, and execute permissions to owner, group, and others. Practice with `chmod`.

**Commands & Output:**

```bash
[root@localhost week1] touch myfile.txt
[root@localhost week1] ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May 28 15:06 myfile.txt

[root@localhost week1] chmod 700 myfile.txt
[root@localhost week1] ls -l myfile.txt
-rwx------. 1 root root 0 May 28 15:06 myfile.txt

[root@localhost week1] chmod 640 myfile.txt
[root@localhost week1] ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r-----. 1 root root 0 May 28 15:06 myfile.txt
```

**Explanation:**  
- `chmod`: Changes file permissions using symbolic or numeric modes.
- `touch myfile.txt`: Creates an empty file named `myfile.txt`.
- `chmod 700`: Gives full permissions (read, write, execute) to the owner only.
- `chmod 640`: Sets read/write for owner, read for group, and no permissions for others.

### üîπ Task 2: Basic Linux File Commands

**Objective:**  

Practice basic file/directory commands: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`, etc.

**Commands:**

```bash
[root@localhost ~] mkdir test_folder
[root@localhost ~] cd test_folder
[root@localhost test_folder] touch file1.txt
[root@localhost test_folder] ls
file1.txt
[root@localhost test_folder] rm file1.txt
[root@localhost test_folder] cd ..
[root@localhost ~]# rmdir test_folder
```

**Explanation:**  
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `cd`: Changes directory.
- `touch`: Creates an empty file.
- `rm`: Deletes files.
- `rmdir`: Deletes an empty directory.

---

### üîπ Task 3: File Navigation & Moving Files

**Objective:**  

Move files between folders and navigate using CLI command mv.

**Commands:**

[root@localhost ~]# mkdir test1 test2
[root@localhost ~]# touch test1/file.txt
[root@localhost ~]# mv test1/file.txt test2/
[root@localhost ~]# cd /root/celebal/week1/test2
[root@localhost folderB]# ls
file.txt
```

**Explanation:**  
- `mv`: Moves file from one folder to another.
- `cd` & `ls`: Navigate and list contents.

### üîπ Task 4: User and Group Management

**Objective:**  
Create user/group and set proper file ownership and access.

**Commands:**

```bash
[root@localhost ~]# groupadd devops
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -m -G devops dev
[root@localhost ~]# passwd dev
[root@localhost ~]# usermod -aG wheel dev
[root@localhost week1]# userdel -r dev
[root@localhost week1]# id dev
id: ‚Äòdev‚Äô: no such user

[root@localhost week1]# chown vivek:devops test1/
[root@localhost week1]# ls -l
total 0
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root  root    0 May 28 15:06 myfile.txt
drwxr-xr-x. 2 vivek devops 25 May 28 17:11 test1

-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root  root    0 May 28 15:06 myfile.txt
drwxr-xr-x. 2 vivek devops 25 May 28 17:11 test1
drwxrwx---. 2 root  root   25 May 28 17:10 test2

[root@localhost week1]# userdel -r vivek 
[root@localhost week1]# id vivek
id: ‚Äòvivek‚Äô: no such user
[root@localhost week1]# groupdel devops
```

**Explanation:**

```

Output (first attempt):

```
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/VivekSingh12330/celebalintern/'
```

* Push failed due to password authentication being disabled.

Output (second attempt):

```
! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/VivekSingh12330/celebalintern'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally.
```

* Push rejected because remote has commits that local branch doesn‚Äôt.

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

Output:

```
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```

* Fetches remote changes and rebases local commits on top.

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Output:

   9ed6e65..117d53e  main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

* Push successful, sets upstream tracking for `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

Output:

```
Switched to a new branch 'feature-branch'
```

* Creates and switches to `feature-branch`.

```bash
echo "This is a feature branch file" > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added feature.txt in feature-branch"
```

Output:

```
[feature-branch f04475a] Added feature.txt in feature-branch
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 feature.txt
```

* Adds and commits new file in feature branch.

```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch
```

Output:

```
To https://github.com/VivekSingh12330/celebalintern
 * [new branch]      feature-branch -> feature-branch
branch 'feature-branch' set up to track 'origin/feature-branch'.
```

* Pushes feature branch to remote and tracks it.

```bash
git checkout main
```

Output:

```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

* Switches back to main branch.

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

Output:

```
Updating 117d53e..f04475a
Fast-forward
 feature.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 feature.txt
```

* Merges feature branch into main with fast-forward.

```bash
git push origin main
```

* Pushes merged changes to remote main branch.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

* Moves HEAD back one commit but keeps changes staged.

```bash
git rm unwantedfile.txt
```

Output:

```
fatal: pathspec 'unwantedfile.txt' did not match any files
```

* File doesn't exist, so removal failed.

```bash
echo "This is an unwanted file" > unwantedfile.txt
git add unwantedfile.txt
git commit -m "Added file"
```

Output:

```
[main 89d141d] Added file

```

Output:

```
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/VivekSingh12330/celebalintern'
```

* Push rejected because local branch is behind remote.

```bash
echo "Line B from main" > conflict.txt
git add conflict.txt
git commit -m "Main: Add Line B"
```

Output:

```
[main 6d3dbb5] Main: Add Line B
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 conflict.txt
